# CCI_ACC_W3_PythonTextGame
This is a simple text game in Python, and I also wrote my answer in the document; if I have more ability to write plots or mathematics, there should be a more exciting and rich story:

```python

--- readMe ---
I added some obfuscator,
and the code under print("Task...") should be written by the player
I have provided some examples.
The normal version can be viewed in copy_main.py

one day, an email appeared in your mailbox:
ouch! dear friends, their plan has already begun...you have to give this code to Math as soon as...
